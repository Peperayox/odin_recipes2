    <h1>Crisp Salmon</h1>
    <img src="../images/salmon.jpeg" alt="Crisp Salom frying on a black steel stove">
    <h4> <em>Salmon:</em> A proteic and omega 3 infused superfood</h4>
    <p> Fresh, Asian-inspired salmon fillets with a crispy skin and an orange, ginger, 
        and honey glaze. Unlike most similar recipes, this 
        one is made without soy sauce and with totally fresh ingredients. The result 
        is a bright, fresh fish with great taste and texture. The fresh ingredients 
        are the star here: <strong>Don't substitute with dried, powdered, or frozen ingredients!</strong>
        I served on top of rice and steamed broccoli garnished with green onions.

    <ul>
        <li>½ cup freshly squeezed orange juice </li>
        <li>¼ cup honey </li>
        <li>¼ cup rice vinegar </li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil </li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons grated fresh ginger </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine orange juice, honey, vinegar, olive oil, 
            garlic, ginger, sesame seeds, salt, and pepper in a large
             resealable plastic bag.
             Add salmon. Seal and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Place a large cast iron 
            skillet in the oven. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
        <li> Carefully remove skillet from oven when it just barely starts to smoke. 
            Add vegetable oil and place salmon fillets, skin-side down, in the skillet.</li>
        <li> Bake in the hot oven until fish flakes easily 
            with a fork, or to your desired doneness, 5 to 9 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>                 
    </ol>
