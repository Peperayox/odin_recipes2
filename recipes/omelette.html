    <h3><strong><em>Omelettes</em></strong> the best off eggs </h3>
    <p>Omelettes offer a tasty way of combining eggs, cheese , spices and vegtables
        in a solid mix that is easy to eat. I eat them for breakfast most mornings 
    and it's taste and health benefits should warrant you to eat them too </p>
    <p> It's ideal for quick meals, for lightweight yet fufilling meals and por those who
        wish a balanced infusion of vitamins and minerals while getting all their daily protein
        needs
    </p>
